                    <hr>
                    <br> Curlingmon is an in development mobile game based on
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curling">Curling</a> with cute creatures and fun challenges. As the project is being developed in a very small
                    team I'm involved in basically everything, but my main focus is on writing the server part of the application
                    that will store player's information and serve as backend to the game.

                    <br> Dark Woods was my entry for
                    <a href="https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39">Ludum Dare #39</a>. This project was developed in 48h by
                    <a href="https://annepagno.carbonmade.com/">an artist</a> and me. We came up with the idea of the project and implemented everything from scratch
                    using <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> as game engine.

                    <hr>
                    <br> Sleep Under the Rain was a "gamejam" project for GDS that
                    <a href="https://annepagno.carbonmade.com/">Anne</a> and me developed in 2016. We came up with the idea of trying to mix 2D platformer game mechanics
                    with a bit of storytelling. We had two months to develop the project from scract. We used <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> as
                    game engine.

                    <br> MatMate was another learning project that
                    <a href="https://annepagno.carbonmade.com/">Anne</a> and me developed. This one was much more focused in exploring simple 2D platformer mechanics
                    like wall jumping and conveyor belts. MatMate was developed using
                    <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a>

                    <br> Yggdrasil was a learning project that
                    <a href="https://annepagno.carbonmade.com/">Anne</a> and me develped back in 2012. We aimed to launching the game on the unfulfilling
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouya">OUYA</a> platform. The project was developed using
                    <a href="https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a>.
