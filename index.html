            I'm Bruno Pagno, <br>

              I've been writing software for 12 or so years, and I have packed up a bit of experience. I've worked mostly as a <strong>backend</strong> developer, but I also have seen my share of <strong>frontend</strong> and <strong>game</strong> development. I'm passionate about coding and learning new technologies.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              Currently I'm working at <a href="https://klara.com/" target="_blank">Klara</a> in Berlin (Germany) as a <strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>.

          <p>
            I worked at the Brazilian branch on "Financial Services", where I lead a team of developers in creating an internal application for dealing with customer's data.
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on the development and mainentance of webservices using <strong>Dot Net Core</strong> and <strong>ReactJS</strong>. I also did a bunch of devops and testing. The team pretty much had the responsibility of making the software from start to finish so automatization and quality assurance were some of my day to day responsibilities.

            </div>
            <p>
              In my short period working for Sicredi I got the chance to actually be a part of it's digital transformation working in the <a href="https://woopsicredi.com/" target="_blank">Woop</a> project. The idea was to create a completelly new digital bank and try to attract more younger clients.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked on the development of webservices in <strong>Java</strong> that deal with credit card operations and their data. My daily activities included developing software with <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>Netty</strong> frameworks, and Oracle database. The application I was responsible for was a data aggregation service that received and compiled all credit card information from the platform, and was responsible for publishing notifications to users.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this time I also became more interested in Data Science since I was working with a relatively large (and interesting) amount of data. This interest caused me to take a <a href="https://confirm.udacity.com/DTJVDDTK" target="_blank">Data Science nanodegree at Udacity</a> which I concluded soon after leaving the company.

            As a researcher I developed a project to monitor user's activities using several different sensor's data. The main idea was to aggregate different data sources that could provide any information related to a user and aggregate them in a single visualization. This ended up being an extensive data wrangling work to build a prototype visualization that we named "EverydayVis".

          <p>
            During this period I published 4 papers which can be accessed through my <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bruno_Pagno">ResearchGate</a>.

              I spent almost two years working on Looney Tunes World of Mayhem while integrating <strong>Aquiris's</strong> engineering staff.
            </p>
            <p>
              Initially I worked developing a webtool for balancing the game. Basically it was an application that served as a operations tool allowing operators to add and remove content from the game in real time. We decided to develop this application with Grails framework. Eventually the interface's needs required us to use a dedicated frontend framework and we added a <strong>ReactJS</strong> layer for presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              After one year as a "tools developer" I actually got a chance to work directly with the mobile game that you see in the video above. It was then that I actually got to apply game development skills that I had only used in private projects previously.

            I had the chance to help building <a href="https://netshow.me/">NetShow.me</a> since the very beginning. The application is a platform for live bradcasting through the web. The idea of building a streaming application was a very interesting technical challenge by the time.

          <h2>Game jams</h2>
          <p>
            I must say that I like video games a lot and that they are an important part of my life. So much that I actually dedicated some of my free time to some game development projects. The two projects that I enjoyed the most are:
            <div class="littleblock">
              <img class="littlebox" src="img/darkwoods.jpg" />
              <p>
                <strong>Dark Woods</strong> was my entry for <strong>Ludum Dare #39</strong>. This project was developed in 48h by <a href="https://annepagno.carbonmade.com/" target="_blank">an artist</a> and myself. We came up with the idea of the project and implemented everything from scratch using <strong>Unity3D</strong> as game engine.
              </p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="littleblock">
              <img class="littlebox" src="img/sutr.jpg" />
              <p>
                <strong>Sleep Under the Rain</strong> was another gamejam project for GDS that <a href="https://annepagno.carbonmade.com/" target="_blank">Anne</a> and I developed in 2016. We came up with the idea of trying to mix 2D platformer game mechanics with a bit of storytelling. We had two months to develop the project from scract. We used <strong>Unity3D</strong> as game engine.
