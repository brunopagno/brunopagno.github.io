  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>
    I am a software engineer who has been typing keyboards for almost two decades. My skills lie mostly on <strong>web</strong> things, but I have done a bit of <strong>game development</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like to nerd about technology 💻. I love cats 🐈. And I deeply appreciate coffee ☕. Not necessarily in this order.
  </p>
  <p>
    Doing open source at <a href="https://www.openproject.org/" target="_blank">OpenProject</a>
